## Interval coding 
this was very difficult as there was two layers of inteval I wanted to operate - one of the water drop moving down, and another of the recursive water drop. 
I couldn't quite figure out how to get multiple drops of water using two set interval functions, so it instead repeats itself when the water reaches the bottom 

## Conditionals for speed
I wanted the water to slowly spee3d up as it flowed down the screen, so I used conditonals based on the height of the water drop - it worked ! 

## cue on command
Next, to use the setTimeout function, I coded so that the water would 'turn on' when the mouse was clicked.
